We propose Ontology-enhanced Entity Linking (OnEL), a novel method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in BioEL by leveraging hierarchical ontology structures for enhanced entity representation. Additionally, we introduce CLOnEL, a framework that leverages continual learning (CL) to validate the effectiveness and broad potential of CL in the BioEL domain.
